# My Values

I approach programming as a craft, dedicated to creating durable, long-lasting, useful code. As a leader, I build diverse, creative teams that produce great software. I'm [fast and good](https://avdi.codes/fast-and-good/).

I was very inspired by an early, pivotal encounter with the Ruby programming language, which introduced me to an open source, free culture ethos and community that shaped who I am today.
